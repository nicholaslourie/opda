Release
=======
To make a new release, follow the process below.


Before a Release
================
Before making a release, review the following maintenance tasks:

1. Consider updating the development dependencies in
   :source-file:`pyproject.toml`, especially the packaging tools:
   `build <https://build.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ and `twine
   <https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.
2. Check if any backwards compatability code can be dropped. Run:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ { \
           echo "file:line number:comment"; \
           echo "----:-----------:-------"; \
           git grep \
             --line-number \
             --only-matching \
             --ignore-case \
             --recursive \
             -- \
             "# backwards compatibility.*$" \
             . \
           | grep --invert-match "\.rst:"; \
        } | column -t -s':'

   The command produces a table summarizing all backwards
   compatibility code in the codebase.


Making a Release
================
Decide the next version based off the :doc:`Changelog </changelog>`
using `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_. Let
``${VERSION}`` denote the version to release. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ VERSION="v1.0.0"

Then:

1.  Create a new branch:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ git checkout -b "bump-version-to-${VERSION}"

2.  Update and commit any changes to :source-file:`CHANGELOG.rst`:

    a. Clean up and combine existing entries if appropriate.
    b. Follow the instructions from the source code comment in
       :source-file:`CHANGELOG.rst` to finalize the "Unreleased"
       section for a new release.
    c. Commit the changes with the message: ``"Finalize changelog for
       release ${VERSION}"``.

3.  Update the ``project.version`` key to ``${VERSION}`` in
    :source-file:`pyproject.toml`, and commit the change with the
    message: ``"Bump version to ${VERSION}"``.
4.  Open and merge a pull request for the branch.
5.  Update the ``main`` branch:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ git checkout main && git pull
       $ git branch --delete "bump-version-to-${VERSION}" && git fetch --prune

    Tag the **merge** commit with ``git``:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ git tag --annotate "${VERSION}" --message "Release ${VERSION}"

    Then push the tag back to the remote:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ git push origin "${VERSION}"

6.  Check that the :repo-workflow:`release workflow <release.yml>`
    completes successfully.
7.  View the documentation that the :repo-workflow:`release workflow
    <release.yml>` just deployed.
8.  Download the package artifact, ``dist``, that the
    :repo-workflow:`release workflow <release.yml>` built for the tag.
    You may also inspect the packages' contents by viewing the logs from
    ``Build and test artifacts. > Package the source. > List the
    packages' contents.``.

    Once you have the artifact, unzip it in your repository to the
    ``dist/`` directory:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ rm -rf dist/
       $ unzip -d "dist/" dist.zip && rm dist.zip

9.  Ensure the ``TWINE_USERNAME``, ``TWINE_TESTPYPI_PASSWORD``, and
    ``TWINE_PYPI_PASSWORD`` environment variables are available. See
    the `PyPA documentation
    <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-the-distribution-archives>`_
    for details. Then, run the ``release`` session with ``nox``:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ nox --session release -- dist/

    This session will upload the package to `TestPyPI
    <https://test.pypi.org/>`_, validate it from TestPyPI, then upload
    to `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_, and finally validate it from PyPI.
10. Make a :repo-release:`GitHub Release <new>` out of the new tag.

    a. Select the tag for the release.
    b. Use the tag's name, ``${VERSION}``, for the release title.
    c. Link to the release's section of the :doc:`Changelog
       </changelog>` in the release description.
    d. Acknowledge anyone who contributed to the release at the end of
       the description.
    e. Submit the release.

Congratulations! The release is complete!
